# Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

Geoff's Clubhouse community is an invite-only, subscription-based members club to provide a home for seasoned, yet unconnected agilists to explore and support with some exclusive, pulled content to support their specific challenges and professional growth. It is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Geoff's Clubhouse a positive, successful, and growing community.


## Our Values

Members of the Geoffs Clubhouse community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

 * **Openly share and receive.** Members of the community will share their truth as they see it, receive others truths as they see it and interpret contributions positively.
 * **Consider what is best for the community.** Members are not here to score points or further themselves at the expense of the community. Community growth and support of one another is our number one priority.
 * **Respect time, effort and diversity.** Members are respectful of the volunteer nature of the contributions of others and that there is rarely a "right answer". We're respectful when addressing the efforts of others and the different perceptions caused by different experiences, cultures and beliefs.
 * **Respect members' safety and comfort.** Different members have different levels of comfort when it comes to participation, challenge and feedback. As members our over-riding aim is to create a safe environment for everyone to contribute how they feel comfortable to do so.
 * **Consider inclusive language.** Members bring people in to conversations; not exclude them either consciously or unconsciously. We consider our language carefully to encourage this.


## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. Geoff's Clubhouse community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.


### Scenarios We Wish To Avoid

 * Misuse of the community's exclusive content
 * A sense of unfairness if we adopt a PPP-model of payment
 * Misuse of the community's brand or content for commercial gains
 * Cultural misunderstandings
 * Harassment of or threats to any participants in any form
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
 * Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks
 * Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule
 * Excessive swearing
 * Unwelcome sexual attention or advances including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
 * Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
 * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Consequences

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, Geoff's Clubhouse community Code of Conduct team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of membership fees paid. The full list of consequences for inappropriate behavior is listed in [ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES].

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
